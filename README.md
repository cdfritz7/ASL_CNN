## **Convolutional Neural Networks for American Sign Language Letter Identification**

This was an individual research project done to explore the applications
of convolutional neural networks to ASL letter signs. The CNN was trained
on images of 24 hand signs (excluding 'J' and 'Z' as they require motion) from
6 users. The CNN was able to achieve over 99% test accuracy when trained
and tested on images from all 6 users, and was able to to achieve accuracies
from ~45-70% when trained on 5 users and tested on the last.

If you want to read more, my research poster is included. I did not include
the data I used to train the network, as the file sizes were too large to upload
to github. If you'd like access to the data, contact me and I'll set it
up on a file sharing site!
